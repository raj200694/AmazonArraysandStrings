Kth smallest means arrange the elements in ascending order and the kth element is kth smallest
Kth largset means arrange the elements in descending order and the kth element is kth largest


for kth smallest if we use maxheap
do build heapify of k elements and from n-k to k if(arr[i]<element at top of heap) then rep;ace and heapifty

for kth largest if we use minhesp
do build heapify of k elements and from n-k to k if(arr[i]>element at top of heap) then rep;ace and heapifty
