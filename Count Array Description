Regarding the count array

if you want all the english alphabets and letters
declare the count array with 256 chars
and do count[str[i]]++

if you want only small english alpahabets a to z
declare count array with size 26
and count[str[i]-'a']++;

if you want a to z and A to Z
then declare count array size 52
count[str[i]-'A']++;
